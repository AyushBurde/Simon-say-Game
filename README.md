Hi everyone I've made this Simon-say game by using Javascript. Basically the structure of the game designs in a way and it goes like :
 1. Press any key to start the game , then one box will flash out of 4 .
 2. Then the next step is you have to press the same box which flashed by pressing any key , then again some random box will flash .
 3. And this process continous till you press any box which doesn't flash at all
 4. You just have to follow the order of the box which are flashing
 5. eg. You press any key and red box flash - press red box , then green flash , order be like - press Red , Green . Now again one random box will flash e.g blue . then the
 6. order be like - You have to press Red Green Blue . If you press some other box then the game will automatically quit.
